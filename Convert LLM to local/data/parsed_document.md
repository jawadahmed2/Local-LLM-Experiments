# CFO Outlook Commentary

We expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5-39 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.

We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94-99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.

We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.

Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.

In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.

Q1 was a good start to the year. We're seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.

CFO Outlook Commentary
We expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36\.5\-39 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 
1% headwind to year\-over\-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.
We expect full\-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96\-99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94\-99 billion 
due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully 
year\-over\-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem. 
We anticipate our full\-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35\-40 billion, increased from our prior range of 
$30\-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap. 
While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year 
as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.
Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full\-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid\-teens.
In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in 
the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.
Q1 was a good start to the year. We're seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress 
on our longer\-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services 
over the coming years.

Forward\-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward\-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward\-
looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the 
impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability 
to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and 
mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third\-party 
policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as 
other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community 
growth and engagement and the user experience over short\-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and 
reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government 
actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and 
government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security 
breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically\-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors 
affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from 
the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10\-K filed with the 
SEC on February 2, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at 
www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10\-Q for the quarter ended 
March 31, 2024\. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is April 24, 2024, and any forward\-looking statements 
contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update 
these statements as a result of new information or future events.
For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled "Limitations of 
Key Metrics and Other Data" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.
Non\-GAAP Financial Measures 
To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non\-GAAP financial measures: revenue 
excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation 
of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information 
prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the 
use of non\-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non\-GAAP 
financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these 
limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non\-GAAP financial measures.
We believe these non\-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial 
performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent 
of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our 
business. 
Our non\-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items: 
Foreign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 using the prior year's 
monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that 
facilitates comparison to our historical performance.
Purchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and 
equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that 
these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, 
regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide 
useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not 
intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. 
For more information on our non\-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non\-GAAP measures, please see 
the "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non\-GAAP Results" table in this press release.
