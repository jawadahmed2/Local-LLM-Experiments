Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Antoine Roux, Arthur Mensch, Blanche Savary, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Emma Bou Hanna, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Bour, Guillaume Lample, LÃ©lio Renard Lavaud, Lucile Saulnier, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Sandeep Subramanian, Sophia Yang, Szymon Antoniak, Teven Le Scao, ThÃ©ophile Gervet, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, TimothÃ©e Lacroix, William El Sayed Abstract We introduce Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model. Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine- tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B â Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B â chat model on human bench- marks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.',\n",

However, RG-2L struggles to dis- tinguish query-document pairs with higher (> 3.0) ranking scores from RG-S(0, 4) and scores them al- most equally with scores close to 1.0. This suggests that providing more fine-grained relevance labels helps the LLM differentiate better among some query-document pairs, particularly with the top- ranked documents. When we compare the ranking scores from RG-3L where more than 2 relevance levels are used (Figure 3(b)), there is almost no such â',\n",

The performance of RG-3L and RG-S(0, 4) are also very close. # 6 Conclusion In this work, we explore the use of more fine- grained relevance labels in the prompt for point- wise zero-shot LLM rankers instead of the binary labels used in existing works. We propose to ei- ther provide intermediate relevance labels such as â Somewhat Relevantâ as additional choices for the LLM or ask the LLM to rate the relevance between query-document pairs using a rating scale. Then we aggregate the likelihood of different relevance levels into ranking scores to obtain the ranked list. Our experiments on BEIR data sets demonstrate that prompting with fine-grained relevance labels can consistently improve the ranking performance across different data sets, as it enables the model to better differentiate query-document pairs poten- tially ranked at the top. We believe our discovery can be further extended to applications beyond information retrieval. For example, the same method can be applied for rec- ommendation (Fan et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023), where the LLM is asked to rate how likely a user would buy an item.',\n",

However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmless- ness presents a significant challenge during LLM training.

Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowdworkersâ confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an opti- mization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model perfor- mance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms.

RLHF leverages LLMsâ broad knowledge and capabilities to promote desired responses and behaviors, which leads to safer, higher-performing, and more controllable AI systems. Both technical reports from GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and Anthropic (Ganguli et al., 2022) for their LLMs revealed their use of safety-related prompts, constructed through adversarial probing methods like red-teaming, in the RLHF phase to reduce the potential harm of their model. However, the pursuit of increasing helpfulness and harmlessness may often contradict in practice (Ganguli et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a). For example, a model refusing to answer can be considered safe, yet it also renders the response unhelpful in extreme scenarios. Thus, a significant challenge arises in balancing the two objectives during the training phase. Our goal is to develop a large language model that is helpful, safe, and willing to respond. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel framework: Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF). The core insight of Safe RLHF is the decoupling of human prefer- ences during data annotation and the establishment of two optimization objectives: helpfulness and harmlessness (as shown in equation (9)). Safe RLHF formalizes the goal of developing harmless LLMs as a constraint under the Safe RL framework. It is crucial that we need a balance between helpfulness and harmlessness objectives, and avoid over-optimizing for harmlessness. # The decoupling of preferences and objectives offers two advantages:',\n",

This framework incorporates a two-dimensional human annotation scheme and a safe training mechanism to enhance model performance while ensuring safety (as shown in Figure 1). Experi- mentally, we applied the Safe RLHF pipeline three times, significantly enhancing the helpfulness of the base SFT model while efficiently reducing the generation of harmful responses.

We follow the annotation methodology outlined in Ji et al. (2023), in which the rankings for helpfulness and harmlessness were explicitly decoupled from a singular human preference dimension. In this strategy, crcowdworkers annotate a safety meta- label for each question-answer (QA) pair, considering 14 predefined categories of potential harm. A QA pair is labeled as â safeâ only if it poses no risk across all 14 categories. Subsequently, the annotators are given two responses to the same prompt and asked to rank the harmlessness and helpfulness, treating each criterion independently. The detailed annotation guidelines can be found in the Appendix section A. Following the annotation pipeline, we produce a helpfulness-related dataset, Dr = {2', yi, yj },_1> N Following the annotation pipeline, we produce a helpfulness-related dataset, Dr = {2', yi, yj },_1> N and a harmlessness-related dataset, Do = {oi ivf, si, sf} .

In summary, we would expect a helpfulness preference B > A, a harmlessness preference A > B, as well as harmfulness signs for the two responses s(A) = â 1 and s(B) = +1. 3.2 PREFERENCE MODEL FITTING: REWARD AND COST MODELS We train two independent preference models to fit human preference distributions across the help- fulness and harmlessness aspects of LLM responses.

Hence, we aim to maximize the probability of y â » y0|x: p(y â » y0|x) = Ï (CÏ (y, x) â CÏ (y0, x)) = Ï (CÏ (y, x)) = Ï (s(y) Â· CÏ (y, x)) .

This task is not straightforward using RL methods. In light of this, we reformulate the safety constraint into an expectation form, paralleling the structure of the objective function. This modification introduces a hyper-parameter d, devised to exert control over the probability of generating harmful responses. Our surrogate objective is presented as follows: maximize Î¸ JR(Î¸), s.t. JC(Î¸) â ¤ 0, (10) where JR(Î¸) â Exâ ¼D,yâ ¼Ï Î¸(Â·|x) [RÏ (y, x)] , JC(Î¸) â Exâ ¼D,yâ ¼Ï Î¸(Â·|x) [CÏ (y, x)] + d, (11) which represent the expected reward and the expected cost objective function respectively. To address this constrained problem, we leverage the Lagrangian method, a technique for finding the local maxima and minima of a function over a constraint set. This application allows us to convert the constrained primal problem, as defined in equation (10), into its unconstrained Lagrangian dual form as follows: min Î¸ max Î»â ¥0 [â JR(Î¸) + Î» Â· JC(Î¸)], (12) where Î» â',\n",

Each cycle involves Red Teaming (excluding the first round), generating and annotating human preference data, training the Reward Model and Cost Model, and Safe RL fine-tuning. The implementation details and training hyper-parameters are available in Appendix B and Appendix C.1. Initial SFT Model. Our primary experiments begin with the Alpaca-7B model (reproduced). This model is derived from instruction fine-tuning the LLaMA-7B (Touvron et al., 2023a) using the Al- paca open-source dataset (Taori et al., 2023), which boasts 52K instruction-following instances. We selected Alpaca-7B as our initial model for two primary reasons. First, Alpaca-7B embodies essen- tial chat assistant capabilities and has an appropriate model size, facilitating the full implementation of the Safe RLHF pipeline. Second, Alpaca-7B is capable of generating both harmless and po- tentially harmful responses, offering varied responses to identical prompts, as shown in Figure 3b. Using Alpaca-7B as our starting point in multiple iterative RL fine-tuning allows us to more clearly discern improvements in the safety and utility of LLMs when employing the Safe RLHF pipeline.

Following the annotation scheme we designed in Section 3.1, we obtain decoupled datasets for helpfulness and harmlessness. More details and examples are available in Appendix A. Evaluation Datasets. Since the lack of evaluation datasets that consider both helpfulness and safety alignment, we constructed our own evaluation prompt dataset, comprising 3 parts: prompts meticulously designed for 14 safety categories, prompts sourced from open-source datasets (ex- cluded from training), and a selected 10% of prompts from each red-teaming phase. The definition of the 14 safety categories are detailed in Appendix A.3. 4.2 EXPERIMENT RESULTS 4.2.1 HELPFULNESS AND HARMLESSNESS EVALUATION To rigorously assess the efficacy of our Safe RLHF pipeline along two alignment dimensions â helpfulness and harmlessness â we analyze models from three iterations of Safe RLHF: Beaver- v1, Beaver-v2, and Beaver-v3. However, evaluating large language models has consistently been a challenging and unresolved problem. Traditional benchmarks often do not capture the full extent to which a model aligns with human values. This shortcoming is largely attributable to inconsistent standards and unequivocal outcomes in human alignment evaluation. Thus, we prefer to assess large language models based on their responses to specific prompts. We employ two methods for overall assessment. These include a rapid evaluation of our models using our trained unified Reward Model and Cost Model; deriving the Elo score by comparing model outputs with human judgments and GPT-4 evaluations.

Note that we do not employ these unified models to train a single-round Safe RLHF process, as the preference data ac- quisition occurs iteratively. We need intermediate models for the red-teaming procedure, facilitating the collection of new prompts for the follow-up training phases. As illustrated in Figure 4, our SFT model, the Alpaca-7B model (reproduced), has the ability to produce both harmless and harmful responses that are almost evenly separated on each side of the c = 0 dividing line (Figure 4a).

GPT-4 and Human Evaluations. For more accurate assessments, we compare models against each other to generate associated Elo scores, as described in Askell et al. (2021). Specifically, evaluators compare the outputs of two models in response to the same prompt and provide their preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness. After obtaining pairwise win-rate relationships between all models, we fit corresponding Elo scores (with an initial score of 1200). According to Chiang & Lee (2023), GPT-4 can replace human evaluators in assessing the alignment capabilities of LLMs. Therefore, we have organized assessments involving both GPT-4 and human evaluators. As shown in Figure 5a and 5b, the three rounds of Safe RLHF significantly improved the Elo scores in both helpfulness and harmlessness, as evaluated by both GPT-4 and human evaluators. When compared to Alpaca-7B, the Beaver-v3 model demonstrated an increase in the Elo score for helpful- ness (GPT-4: +244.91, Human: +363.86) and for harmlessness (GPT-4: +268.31, Human: +237.98).

During the third round, since the model was sufficiently safe, Safe RLHF tended to prioritize maintaining the current harmlessness level over excessive optimization. This is also reflective of the dynamic adjustment characteristics inherent to Safe RLHF. Meanwhile, our crowdworkers also labeled whether the modelsâ responses are safe, as shown in Figure 5c. Through three rounds of Safe RLHF training, the Beaver-v3 modelâ s probability of harmful responses on the evaluation set decreased from 53.08% for Alpaca-7B to 2.45%.

We use the responses collected from the first round of Safe RLHF to carry out preference labeling and PPO training following the conventional RLHF methodology. During the preference labeling, the difference is that only a comprehensive preference is provided, while other aspects align with Safe RLHF. Compared to single-dimensional annotation and training, we observe the following advantages of Safe RLHF: First, decoupling the annotations for helpfulness and harmlessness results in higher Inter-Rater Agreement Rate among crowdworkers, which is Helpfulness: 69.00% and Safety: 66.53% compared to 61.65%. Second, the agreement between crowdworkers and researchers (i.e. approval rate) is also increased. In single-dimensional annotation, the average approval rate dur- ing a 10% quality inspection drops from at least 90% accuracy to below 80%. Third, as shown in Figure 6a, using the above data for PPO training results in a notable improvement in helpfulness. However, the enhancement in harmlessness is significantly less than that achieved by Safe RLHF. In contrast, Safe RLHF allows a subjective adjustment in the training phase to balance helpfulness and harmlessness.',\n",

Human preferences provide the direction for optimization, while predictions of safety labels facilitate the dynamic balance of helpfulness and harmlessness objectives. This suc- cessful integration contributes to the success of Safe RLHF. To substantiate this, we compared Safe RLHF with the training using the logits of a safety classifier as the cost signals (Glaese et al., 2022). As illustrated in Figure 6a (CM-classifier), the latterâ s efficiency in improving harmlessness is sig- nificantly inferior to that of Safe RLHF.

(2023) discuss extreme risks, including dangerous capabilities and misalign- ments. The issue of societal biases in language generation is addressed by Sheng et al. (2021), while Abid et al. (2021) focuses explicitly on the persistent Muslim-violence bias in LLMs. Deshpande et al. (2023) examine toxicity in ChatGPT, highlighting issues such as incorrect stereotypes, harmful dialogue, and hurtful opinions. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) While LLMs have excelled in vari- ous NLP tasks, they sometimes exhibit unexpected behaviors such as producing inaccurate informa- tion or making biased, misleading, and harmful responses (Bai et al., 2022a;b; KocoÂ´n et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023b). RLHF enables LLMs to progress towards more diverse goals by learning from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023). Because of the bias and noise in human feedback (Wu et al., 2023), some methods optimizing on a sole preference may lead the model to some local optimal solution (Casper et al., 2023). Some existing methods refine different properties and use different models to match them. Based on these models, LLMs are guided to be fine-tuned to ensure that the models integrate multi- ple properties. However, this approach requires manual adjustment of the weights between rewards and costs (similar to reward shaping) (Touvron et al., 2023b), making it challenging to deploy in different application scenarios rapidly. In contrast, our approach decouples the Helpful and Harm- less, automatically adjusts the trade-off between rewards and costs based on predefined thresholds, and ensures that the model generates high-quality responses while providing a higher level of safety. This process can be extended to scenarios beyond Helpful and Harmless.',\n",

Rrhf: Rank responses to align language models with human feedback without tears. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.05302, 2023. 15 # A DATA ANNOTATION GUIDELINES A.1 OVERVIEW The paper focuses on generating and annotating a dataset of question-answer (QA) pairs to evalu- ate the performance of LLMs in handling harmful or unsafe prompts. In the two-stage annotation pipeline we have adopted, the first stage involves classifying the safety of each QA pair based on 14 pre-defined harm categories, ranging from hate speech to financial crime. A QA pair is considered harmless if it poses no risk across these categories. The second stage involves ranking the generated responses based on their harmlessness and helpfulness, which provides a comprehensive evaluation framework. The dataset covers a broad spectrum of harm categories, including but not limited to hate speech, violence, and financial crimes, among others. Ethical considerations and safety implications are integral to the annotation process. The harmlessness of a QA pair is gauged by its risk-neutrality across the 14 categories, ensuring alignment with safety guidelines. Conversely, the helpfulness of a response is assessed based on its clarity, relevance, and quality, which is considered distinct from its harmlessness. The two-dimensional ranking of responses enriches the understanding of language model outputs, balancing generation quality and instruction-following with safety considerations. # A.2 DATA GENERATION Figure 3a provides an overview of the data utilized for the iterative refinement of both reward and cost models. In each iteration, data are generated via the most recent RLHF model available. Prompts are predominantly sourced from the works of Ganguli et al. (2022) and Ji et al. (2023). Notably, in Rounds 2 and 3, we incorporate a limited subset of red-team prompts crafted explicitly by our research team to attack the latest RLHF model. To generate responses to these prompts, we randomly sample from the RLHF models using the following parameter settings: temperature = {0.001, 0.5, 1.0, 1.2}, top-K = 50, and top-p = 0.95.

A.4 ANNOTATION DOCUMENTS In our preliminary consultations with the data annotation team, we discovered that crowdworkers may encounter challenges in comprehending artificially decoupled preference dimensions. We have developed two annotation guides to facilitate better alignment between the crowdworkers and the research team. The first guide focuses on the classification of harm categories and offers a range of examples to enhance understanding. The second guide pertains to preference annotation, explaining the distinctions between ranking helpfulness and harmlessness in a given QA pair. Our guides are similarly developed based on the annotation documents in Section D of Ji et al. (2023). A.5 DATA ANNOTATION TEAM Crowdworker Recruitment For this project, we chose to partner with a local data annotation firm, hereafter referred to as our â data partnerâ to maintain anonymity during the double-blinded review process. This entity assumes direct responsibility for crowdworkers recruitment and man- agement. Leveraging their expertise in their previous text annotation projects, our data partner as- sembled a team of skilled annotators aligned with our project requirements. Each selected annotator was required to demonstrate high proficiency in English and undergo a rigorous evaluation process, which requires achieving a minimum accuracy of 90% when compared to answer keys provided by our research team. Out of an initial candidate pool of approximately 200, we ultimately retained 70 annotators who successfully cleared this assessment phase. Although we initially considered utilizing major international platforms like Amazon MTurk and Upwork, we opted for our current partnership to secure more tangible oversight over the entire process, including legal agreements and face-to-face meetings, thereby bolstering the projectâ s likelihood of success. Task Assignment, Annotation Collection, and Quality Control The quality control (QC) pro- cess involves three key stakeholders: the crowdworkers, the QC team of the data partner, and our research team. The data partner is responsible for task allocation, the collection of completed as- signments, and worker training.',\n",

Once a data annotator completes an assigned annotation batch, the batch is automatically routed to the data partnerâ s QC team for initial review. This review is conducted in accordance with the stan- dards provided by our research team. Subsequently, the reviewed batch is sent to our research team for additional quality evaluation. As per our agreed criteria, the research team must sample at least 10% of the data from each reviewed batch, and the percentage agreement must meet or exceed 90% for the batch to be accepted. This threshold was set, recognizing that attaining a 100% agreement rate is neither realistically achievable nor financially sustainable for the annotation service. More- over, aiming for absolute agreement risks introducing additional biases from the research team.

(2022). The RLHF training objective consists of two parts: the RL objective and the PTX pretraining objective. The reward function used in the RL training is the reward model output with an extra per-token KL penalty. Given a prompt x â ¼ Dprompt, we use the current actor model Ï Î¸(y|x) to generate a corresponding response y = a1:T with length T . When the reward for tokens a1:T is defined as: RM 0, 1<t<T, ~RM _ 15 \" Uietva) t=T, (15) rKL t = â log Ï Î¸(at|x, a1:tâ 1) Ï ref(at|x, a1:tâ 1) , (1 â ¤ t â ¤ T ), (16) Ë rt = rRM t + Î²rKL t , (1 â ¤ t â ¤ T ), (17) where Ï ref(Â·|x) is the reference model and Î² â ¥ 0 is the KL panelty coefficient. For each token, there is a dense reward panelized by the KL divergence between the current actor model and the reference model. The reward model (RM) only outputs a sparse reward on the last token. The reference model is a frozen LLM with the initial actor model parameters at the beginning of the RLHF phase. For instance, the reference model is the SFT model (i.e., Alpaca-7B (Taori et al., 2023)) in the first iteration of RLHF. Then in the second iteration of RLHF, the reference model is the RLHF fine-tuned model in the first iteration. In the RLHF fine-tuning phase, we use the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm (Schul- man et al., 2017) to train the LLM. The surrogate PPO clip loss for the RL training objective is formulated as:',\n",

            "where ÂµR, ÂµC are constant coefficients to control the regularization strength. # B.2 DETAILS OF RLHF TRAINING We follow the training procedure proposed by Ouyang et al. (2022). The RLHF training objective consists of two parts: the RL objective and the PTX pretraining objective. The reward function used in the RL training is the reward model output with an extra per-token KL penalty. Given a prompt x â ¼ Dprompt, we use the current actor model Ï Î¸(y|x) to generate a corresponding response y = a1:T with length T . When the reward for tokens a1:T is defined as: RM 0, 1<t<T, ~RM _ 15 \" Uietva) t=T, (15) rKL t = â log Ï Î¸(at|x, a1:tâ 1) Ï ref(at|x, a1:tâ 1) , (1 â ¤ t â ¤ T ), (16) Ë rt = rRM t + Î²rKL t , (1 â ¤ t â ¤ T ), (17) where Ï ref(Â·|x) is the reference model and Î² â ¥ 0 is the KL panelty coefficient. For each token, there is a dense reward panelized by the KL divergence between the current actor model and the reference model. The reward model (RM) only outputs a sparse reward on the last token. The reference model is a frozen LLM with the initial actor model parameters at the beginning of the RLHF phase. For instance, the reference model is the SFT model (i.e., Alpaca-7B (Taori et al., 2023)) in the first iteration of RLHF. Then in the second iteration of RLHF, the reference model is the RLHF fine-tuned model in the first iteration. In the RLHF fine-tuning phase, we use the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm (Schul- man et al., 2017) to train the LLM. The surrogate PPO clip loss for the RL training objective is formulated as:\n",
